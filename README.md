# 🚀 HL7 to FHIR Data Conversion Repository

Welcome to the **HL7 to FHIR Data Conversion Repository**! This repository is your guide to transforming HL7 messages into FHIR-compliant resources, streamlining interoperability and innovation in healthcare IT. 🌐

---

## 📖 What is FHIR?
FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a modern standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It uses web technologies like RESTful APIs and JSON/XML, making data exchange flexible and scalable. This repository aligns with **Da Vinci implementation standards** for payer-provider workflows.
